# Card Scanner Backend - Current Status

## ✅ WORKING

The Flask backend is now **fully operational** and running on **http://localhost:5001**!

### What's Working:
- ✅ Flask server starts successfully
- ✅ Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- ✅ CORS enabled for React frontend  
- ✅ Image upload handling
- ✅ Base64 image processing
- ✅ Lazy initialization of card recognizer

### Test It:
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# Expected response:
# {"message":"Card Scanner API is running","status":"ok"}
```

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: Missing Reference Database

The card recognition feature requires a pre-built reference database of Pokemon cards. This database is currently **missing**, so actual card scanning won't work yet.

### What Happens:
1. Server starts fine ✅
2. Health checks work ✅
3. When you try to scan a card, you'll get an error explaining the missing database

### Why This Happened:
The PyPI `pokemon-card-recognizer` package was supposed to include pre-built references, but had packaging issues. We installed from local source which doesn't include the pre-built data.

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option 1: For Development/Testing (Recommended Now)
Continue with the current setup! The backend works and you can:
- Develop the frontend UI
- Test API integration
- Mock scan results in the frontend
- Build the reference database later when needed

### Option 2: Build Reference Database (For Production)
**Time Required**: 30-60 minutes
**Requirements**: Pokemon TCG API key (free from https://pokemontcg.io/)

See `SETUP_REFERENCE.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 3: Wait for Fixed PyPI Package
The `pokemon-card-recognizer` maintainers may fix the PyPI package in the future.

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Recommended):
1. ✅ Backend is running - keep it running!
2. Start your React frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Update `.env` with `VITE_CARD_SCANNER_API_URL=http://localhost:5001`
4. Test the Card Scanner UI
5. Mock or handle the "no reference database" error gracefully in the frontend

### Later (When Ready for Real Scanning):
1. Get API key from https://pokemontcg.io/
2. Build reference database (see SETUP_REFERENCE.md)
3. Restart backend
4. Real card scanning will then work!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
**Problem**: "Address already in use" on port 5001
**Solution**:
```bash
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9
```

### Import Errors
**Problem**: "No module named 'pokemon_card_recognizer'"
**Solution**: The local source is installed in editable mode. If you get this error:
```bash
cd /Users/prayugsigdel/Coding/pokemon-card-recognizer
pip install -e .
```

### Card Scanning Fails
**Expected**: This is normal! See "Missing Reference Database" section above.

## 📊 Server Status

**Status**: 🟢 Running
**Port**: 5001
**Host**: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from network)
**Mode**: Development
**CORS**: Enabled (all origins)

## 🎯 Summary

The backend is **working perfectly** for its current state! The only limitation is the missing card reference database, which is:
- Not critical for frontend development
- Can be added later when needed
- Expected behavior given the installation issues

You're ready to develop and test the frontend integration! 🚀
